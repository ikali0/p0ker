Alright. Developer mode engaged.
We’re going to restructure this properly — cleaner hierarchy, stronger systems framing, clearer economic math, and tighter engineering boundaries.

No hype. No fluff. Pure architecture.

# Poker-Tube (“Alien” Poker Software)

## Deterministic Adaptive Poker Economy Engine

### System Design, Architecture & Simulation Framework

**Version 1.0 — Production-Grade Prototype Specification**

---

# 1. System Classification

**System Type:**
Financial-grade deterministic simulation engine with dynamic liquidity-based payout pools.

This is not simply a poker game.
It is a configurable wagering economy framework with programmable volatility and tunable house edge.

Core characteristics:

* Deterministic strategy logic
* Liquidity-pool payout architecture
* Simulation-first validation
* Closed-loop economic balancing
* Exploit detection & anomaly monitoring
* Multiplayer-ready backend design

---

# 2. Foundational Design Principles

1. Determinism First
   Identical input state produces identical output state.

2. Economic Isolation
   Decision logic (HT engine) is separated from payout logic (Tube engine).

3. Simulation-Driven Governance
   All parameter changes must be validated via large-run simulation before activation.

4. Configurable Risk Surface
   House edge, volatility, and liquidity elasticity must be tunable.

5. Modular Replaceability
   Every major subsystem must be swappable without refactoring core logic.

---

# 3. Core Game Model

## 3.1 Participants

* 1 Dealer (house-controlled agent)
* N Players (default = 4, configurable)

## 3.2 Round Structure

Each round executes deterministically:

1. Collect antes
2. Shuffle 52-card deck
3. Deal 5 cards to all participants
4. Apply deterministic Hold Type logic
5. Redraw non-held cards
6. Evaluate final hands
7. Resolve vs dealer
8. Process Stack Tube payouts
9. Apply bust penalties
10. Log structured metrics

## 3.3 Objective

Players attempt to beat the dealer’s final 5-card hand.

House revenue derives from:

* Play pot outcomes
* Bust penalties
* Liquidity pool mechanics

---

# 4. Deterministic Hold Type (HT) Engine

## 4.1 Purpose

The HT engine replaces player discretion with deterministic mapping from hand state → hold decision.

This ensures:

* Reproducibility
* Analytical clarity
* Controlled EV distribution
* Elimination of skill variance

---

## 4.2 Formal HT Structure

Each Hold Type must maintain:

```
HT {
    id: string
    priority_rank: int
    hold_mask: bool[5]
    bust_flag: bool
    usage_count: int
    win_count: int
    loss_count: int
    bust_count: int
    expected_value: float
    tube_trigger_rate: float
    variance_contribution: float
}
```

---

## 4.3 Priority Hierarchy

Evaluation must follow strict ordering:

1. Made hands
2. Strong draws (4-straight, 4-flush)
3. Medium draws
4. High-card logic
5. Draw-all fallback

No randomness permitted.

---

## 4.4 Decision Output Schema

```
{
  "ht_id": "H4F",
  "hold_mask": [true, true, true, true, false],
  "discard_mask": [false, false, false, false, true],
  "bust_flag": true,
  "meta": {
      "priority": 2,
      "draw_strength": 0.73
  }
}
```

---

## 4.5 HT Simulation Validation

Monte Carlo validation mode:

* 100,000+ hand runs
* EV confidence intervals
* Standard deviation tracking
* Skew and tail risk evaluation
* Tube interaction frequency

---

# 5. Stack Tube Economic Engine

## 5.1 Conceptual Model

Replace fixed payouts with liquidity reservoirs:

Active Tubes:

* ST (Straight)
* FL (Flush)
* FH (Full House)
* SF (Straight Flush)
* RF (Royal Flush)

These function as dynamic payout pools.

---

## 5.2 Tube Object Definition

```
Tube {
    name: string
    initial_balance: float
    current_balance: float
    total_funded: float
    total_paid: float
    hit_count: int
    depletion_count: int
    volatility_index: float
    stability_score: float
}
```

## 5.3 Payout Function (Modular)

Base model:

```
payout = current_balance × alpha
```

Extended options:

* Fixed payout cap
* Logarithmic scaling
* Progressive multiplier
* Volatility dampening factor
* Liquidity throttling

## 5.4 Refill Logic

Configurable behaviors:

* Player-funded refill
* House-funded refill
* No payout on depletion
* Forced refill below threshold
* Bonus payout above threshold

Trigger system:

```
IF balance < lower_bound:
    auto_refill()

IF balance > upper_bound:
    apply_bonus_distribution()
```

## 5.5 Economic Metrics Per 20,000 Rounds

* House net profit
* House edge %
* Volatility index (σ of round deltas)
* Tube stability score
* Depletion frequency
* Refill frequency

# 6. Round Resolution Engine

## 6.1 Flow

1. Collect antes
2. Execute HT logic
3. Redraw
4. Evaluate hand ranking
5. Compare vs dealer
6. Apply tie rules
7. Allocate pot
8. Process tube payout
9. Apply bust penalty

## 6.2 Configurable Controls

* Dealer_Draw_Allowed
* Dealer_Bust_Allowed
* DealerWinsOnTie
* Bust_Penalty_Multiplier

## 6.3 Structured Round Output

```
{
  "round_id": 17422,
  "player_result": "win",
  "dealer_rank": "FL",
  "player_rank": "FH",
  "ht_id": "H3K",
  "tube_triggered": "FH",
  "bust_applied": false,
  "house_delta": -37.5,
  "player_delta": 37.5,
  "tube_snapshot": {
      "FH_balance": 842.3
  }
}
```

# 7. Mass Simulation & Analytics Engine

* Monte Carlo 100k+
* Multi-run batch stress test

## 7.2 Global Metrics

* Total antes
* Total payouts
* House net
* House edge %
* Player aggregate net

## 7.3 Per-HT Metrics

* Usage %
* Win %
* Loss %
* Bust %
* EV
* Variance

* HT EV > +2%
* Tube drained > 30% rounds
* House edge < 2%
* Refill loops exceed threshold
* Dealer disadvantage clusters

Structured exploit report returned.

# 8. Adaptive Edge Control System

## 8.1 Target

Maintain:

```
0.03 ≤ HouseEdge ≤ 0.07
```

---

## 8.2 Control Equation

```
HouseEdge =
    (Total_Antes - Total_Payouts)
    / Total_Antes
```

---

## 8.3 Adjustment Loop

```
Error = TargetEdge - MeasuredEdge

BustMultiplier      += α * Error
TubeInitialBalances += β * Error
TubeAlpha           += γ * Error
DealerAggression    += δ * Error
```

Re-run simulation until:

* Edge within band
* No HT > +2% EV
* Tube stability above threshold

Closed-loop gradient control system.
